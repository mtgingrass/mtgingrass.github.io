### Kudos to me...
#### Over the years I have collected some things people have said about me and my work. Check them out below.


> Mark you are awesome!! I was getting crushed trying to execute this from using my lectures and spent hours trying to do this before I came across your video... 10 mins later I had it done thanks to your concise tutorial. Thank you so much !!﻿ <br><span class="attrib">- Adrian Jones in response to a C++ tutorial I created. [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/markgingrass)</span>

### Ready for the change...

Who am I really? Where Did I come from? What inspires me to do this?

Let's start from the beginning, well, a long time ago at least. I was 17 years old and enjoying my Advanced Placement C++ course in high-school. I was a junior, in good shape, and a good kid. I spent a lot of hours late at night messing with every setting on my PC and playing in the AOL chat rooms(I just aged myself here). Now to the point. I dropped out of school.

For whatever reason, I dropped out of school worked full time at McDonalds instead. I had enough of that after the summer and applied for community college instead. I took all of the required tests (because I was a drop out, I had to). I was lucky and tested right into Calculus and Comp 1. I felt like I was on track with my former classmates still. I finished year one of my Computer Science Associates degree. Then I decided skateboarding was more fun than school so I didn't go back.

After a couple of years of bouncing from job to job I decided it was time to grow up a bit. I joined the Air Force as an Electronics Technician. I honestly didn't even know the Air Force wore fatigues at all. I thought they wore 'blues' all the time. I didn't know ANYTHING about the military when I joined except for the fact that you were supposedly not allowed to quit. That's what I needed, a forced job!

After four years fixing giant, expensive and complex electronic automated test stations, I felt I could do better on the outside. While I was active duty I managed to take a few classes towards an Electrical Engineering degree. I aced Differential Equations, Circuits I and II, Digital Systems and a few other courses. I remember learning Circuits II the 'hard' way. I didn't memorize the formulas, instead, I derived the formulas for each circuit using my new Differential Equations skills! I was full time working nights for the military, rushing to the college in the morning, and getting some sleep in the afternoons before work the next day. Life was good. I figured I was worth at least 15 dollars an hour at this point. High achiever!

Two months before I departed the military I secured a job doing the exact same thing as I was doing, fixing electronics. Now, I would fix them down to the component level instead of just the circuit card level. Oh, and I am now a civilian doing it at $23 bucks an hour! Time for more though!

I ended up going to what I call a "buy me a degree" school and completing a B.S. in Avionics Management. This was such a joke degree to me. Not to knock others who have this degree but I certainly was not proud. I was used to engineering courses. I was used to people failing. I was used to studying for hours and hours and still getting the problem wrong on the tests. I remember late nights and sleeping on whatever random couch I could find at the school. I didn't have any of that. Instead, I worked full time, took 12 credits at a time, pulled all A's and didn't do any homework at all. Research papers were a joke. Presentations were also a joke. I actually snuck photos of people's presentations just to prove to my girlfriend at the time what a joke this was. She was actually pursuing a PhD in some sort of data analytics field and studied colleges ability to teach students. I don't mean to sound harsh, or stuck up, or a smarty pants, but this is how I felt, and still do. I totally got that degree for a 'check mark' on my resume.

Finally got a "white collar" position after three ish years of fixing electronics. I was now going to be the Equipment Specialist for jet engine parts. I am so not mechanically inclined. I spent years learning electronics and studying electrical engineering and programming. What did I know about Bernoulli's laws? Nothing. Turns out, I didn't need to know that much about the actual parts. I just needed to know about the data behind the parts. This grew on me. I have been dipped into the new world of Supply Chain Management. I never thought I would get into this field and enjoy it. Turns out, Supply Chains are vastly complex and dynamic. I learned everything from demand planning to inventory management to procurement and contracting over the next few years. After a few years I earned an MBA degree and I was promoted to managing logistics for F100 engines. Being the "middle man" for anything that could possibly go wrong was a pretty satisfying job. 

I have become a Subject Matter Expert in the Air Force Supply Chain over the years. I know many of the legacy systems, how they interact, how the timing works, and who uses them. I can communicate with senior leaders and other business units. I can tear down stove pipes or functional areas and get a better end result for the customers. I've finally found a niche. This leads to my current position, an Operations Researcher for the Air Force Supply Chain. Now I get to use the data behind all of these systems to try and pull insights. I can try to flag things that might cause issues down the line. I can predict the future and find correlation with data.

I want something different though. Surely, my years of experience can count for something somewhere else right? Surely, not having an advanced technical degree can stop me right? That's where the me, now, comes in. I fell in love with Machine Learning and programming lately. I can't get enough of it. I've read many books, articles, listened to pod casts and youtube lectures. I've met many people in the industry. I am submerging myself in this new Self Driving Car nano-degree program Udacity hosts. I'm ready to find a new niche in this awesome industry. I'm going to be reaching out, writing, reading, and YouTubing a lot of tutorials, progress, and just about anything in the next few months or years until I land a great fulfilling job.
