I am looking for opportunities to be part of a team in the autonomous vehicle industry.

Self Driving Cars are coming, look out! I am determined to be part of this awesome wave of technology. With 7 years in automated electronics testing, as well as 8 years of team leadership and project/program management experience, and the math/programming background, I have much to offer.

I'm reaching out to those who are willing to bring me on board to be part of the team. Whatever your need, I would be thrilled to take part in advancing the technology. 

I’m willing to relocate, including overseas. Don’t hesitate to get in touch - if you, or anyone you know have a need, I’d love to talk!
